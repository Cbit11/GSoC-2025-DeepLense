# GSoC-2025-Task1
This is the submission for the GSoC-2025 for the DeepLense projects. 
- Task1: Classification of DeepLense substructures using Resnet and have plotted roc curve and auc.
- Task 3A: Implemented super-resolution architecture in Pytorch, and have shown results in terms of loss function, PSNR and SSIM. 
- Task 3B: Have used pretrained model from task 3A and have results in terms of loss function, PSNR and SSIM.
